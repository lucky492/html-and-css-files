         DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLOG ELEMENT AND INLINE ELEMENT

         BLOG ELEMENT:-Blog elements are those tags which occupy the whole
         width of page. FOR Eg- suppose in a web page you have only wrote
         'hello',this hello will occupy the whole width of page.If in another
         blog tag you will 'hy',it will appear below 'hello' and also it will
         occupy the whole width of page.
        
         INLINE ELEMENT:-Inline element are those element which only occupy 
         required space.
